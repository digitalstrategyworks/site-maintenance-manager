Manage WordPress updates, filter comment spam, send branded email reports, and configure SMTP delivery — for single sites and Multisite networks.

== Description ==

Greenskeeper is a professional WordPress maintenance plugin for developers and agencies. It centralises update management for WordPress Core, plugins, and themes, pairs it with a polished email reporting workflow, and adds layered comment spam protection — all from a single purpose-built admin dashboard.

**Updates & Reporting:**

* Scans for available WordPress Core, plugin, and theme updates in separate sections
* Updates items individually or in batch with a real-time progress bar and plain-English error explanations
* Logs every update action automatically — searchable by item name or date range, grouped into sessions
* Builds a branded HTML maintenance report email from each update session and sends it to your client
* Report emails support Update Notes (admin note to recipient) and Additional Manual Updates (for licensed plugins updated outside the plugin)
* Configures reliable SMTP email delivery via nine supported providers — no separate SMTP plugin required
* Manages agency branding: company logo, company name, and default administrator shown on reports
* Works on single-site WordPress installs and Multisite networks
* Multisite: Site Scope Selector on Updates, Spam Log, and Settings — view and manage any single site or the full network from Network Admin

**Spam Filter & Comments:**

* Layer 1 — Local filtering (always active): honeypot hidden field, submission time check, link count limit, keyword blocklist, IP blocklist, duplicate comment detection
* Layer 2 — Akismet cloud filtering (optional): enter your Akismet API key to enable AI-powered spam detection. Automatically skipped when the standalone Akismet plugin is active
* Spam Log page: review every blocked comment attempt — filter by rule or IP, add offending IPs to the blocklist with one click, and bulk-delete entries
* Disable Comments: remove comment support from all post types and hide the Comments admin menu site-wide

**Important — Akismet licensing:** Akismet is free for personal, non-commercial sites only. Any commercial or client site requires a paid Akismet plan available at [akismet.com/plans](https://akismet.com/plans/). Greenskeeper provides the integration; you are responsible for having a valid Akismet licence appropriate for your site's use.

**Supported SMTP Providers:**

SendGrid, Mailgun, Brevo, SendLayer, SMTP.com, Gmail / Google Workspace, Microsoft / Outlook / Office 365, manual SMTP, or WordPress default.

**Who it is for:**

Web developers, digital agencies, and WordPress administrators who manage client sites and need a reliable, repeatable maintenance and security workflow with professional client-facing reporting. Named after the greenskeeper who maintains the golf course — meticulous, professional, invisible.

== Installation ==

= Single-Site Install =

1. In your WordPress admin go to **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**.
2. Upload `greenskeeper.zip` and click **Install Now**.
3. Click **Activate Plugin**.
4. Navigate to **Site Maintenance** in the left-hand admin menu.
5. Open **Settings** and configure your company branding, client email, default administrator, SMTP delivery, and spam filtering.

= Multisite / Network Install =

1. Log in as a Super Admin and go to **Network Admin → Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**.
2. Upload `greenskeeper.zip` and click **Install Now**.
3. Click **Network Activate** to activate across all sites simultaneously, **or** activate per-site from each site's own Plugins screen.
4. Navigate to **Site Maintenance** in the Network Admin menu or any site's admin menu.
5. Each site has its own independent Settings, Update Log, and Email Log.

= Manual Install =

1. Unzip the archive and upload the `greenskeeper` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate from the WordPress Plugins screen.

---

== Using the Plugin ==

= Running Updates =

1. Go to **Site Maintenance → Updates**.
2. The page loads and automatically scans for available updates.
3. The **Performing Administrator** dropdown at the top defaults to your saved default admin (set in Settings). Override it here for this session only.
4. Check the items you want to update — or use **Select All** per section.
5. Click **Update Selected**. Each item updates sequentially with inline feedback.
6. When all items are done, the global success banner appears with a link to **Send Report Email**.

= Sending a Report Email =

1. After running updates, go to **Site Maintenance → Email Reports**.
2. The plugin automatically selects the session you just ran — you will see "Updates from session on [date]" in the Email Template section.
3. Confirm the recipient email (pre-filled from Settings) and edit the subject line if needed.
4. Click **Send Report Email**.
5. The sent email appears in the **Sent Email History** table below.

= Using the Spam Log =

1. Go to **Site Maintenance → Spam Log**.
2. The stats card at the top shows how many attempts each rule has blocked since activation.
3. The table lists every blocked attempt with date, rule, IP address, author details, and a content preview.
4. Click **Block IP** next to any row to add that IP to the blocklist in Settings immediately.
5. Use the **Rule** and **IP** filters to narrow the list. Click **Apply** to filter; **×&nbsp;Clear** to reset.
6. Check individual rows and click **Delete Selected** to remove entries, or **Clear All** to wipe the entire log.

= Previewing a Sent Email =

Click the eye icon in the Sent Email History table. The email renders in a full modal preview using the current template. Even old emails show current branding because the preview always rebuilds the body from the original log entries.

= Resending an Email =

Click **Resend** in the Sent Email History table. The email is rebuilt from the original session entries and sent again to the same recipient.

---

== External Services ==

This plugin connects to one external service: the Akismet API. All other
functionality runs entirely on your own server with no external connections.

= Akismet Spam Filtering (optional) =

**What it is:** Akismet is a cloud-based spam detection service operated by
Automattic, Inc. Greenskeeper includes an optional integration that allows you
to submit comment data to Akismet's API for spam classification.

**This feature is entirely opt-in.** Akismet is only activated if you enter an
Akismet API key in Greenskeeper → Settings → Spam Filter & Comments. If no key
is entered, no data is ever sent to Akismet.

**What data is sent and when:** When Akismet is enabled and a comment is
submitted on your site, Greenskeeper sends the following data to Akismet's API:

* Your site URL
* The commenter's IP address
* The commenter's browser user agent string
* The HTTP referrer header from the comment request
* The URL of the page the comment was submitted on
* The comment type, author name, author email, author URL, and comment content

This data is sent each time a new comment is submitted and passes Greenskeeper's
local filters. If Akismet is unreachable, Greenskeeper fails open (allows the
comment through) rather than blocking it.

Additionally, when you click "Verify & Save Key" in Settings, your Akismet API
key and your site URL are sent to Akismet's verification endpoint to confirm the
key is valid.

**Akismet's terms of service and privacy policy:**

* Terms of service: https://akismet.com/tos/
* Privacy policy: https://automattic.com/privacy/

**Important licensing note:** Akismet's free plan is for personal,
non-commercial sites only. Any commercial or client site requires a paid
Akismet plan. See https://akismet.com/plans/ for details. Greenskeeper provides
the integration; you are responsible for holding a valid Akismet licence
appropriate for your site's use.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does WordPress.org's "Protect The Shire" update policy affect Greenskeeper? =
In June 2026 WordPress.org introduced a mandatory up-to-24-hour hold on all new
plugin and theme updates as part of its "Protect The Shire" initiative. An AI
security scanner reviews code changes during this window before they are
distributed to sites with automatic updates enabled. The policy was introduced
in response to a rise in AI-accelerated supply chain attacks targeting
open-source plugin repositories.

Greenskeeper users are largely unaffected by this delay. The 24-hour hold
applies to automatic background updates — Greenskeeper's workflow is the
opposite of that. Every update you run through Greenskeeper is deliberate,
manually triggered, and documented with a full audit trail. You are not waiting
for WordPress to push an update to your site; you are deciding when and what
to update.

The one area where the delay is felt is in update discovery — a new plugin
release or security patch may not appear on Greenskeeper's Updates page for up
to 24 hours after the developer publishes it, because WordPress.org holds the
release in its review queue before making it available via the update API. If
you need to apply a critical security patch before it appears in the update
queue, you can install the updated plugin manually by downloading it directly
from the developer and uploading it via SFTP or the WordPress plugin upload
screen. Greenskeeper's Update Log and Email Reports pages support manual update
entries so the patch can still be documented and reported to your client even
when applied outside the plugin.


= Can I preview the email report before sending it to the client? =
Yes — from v2.3.1 onward, the Email Reports page includes a "Preview
Email" button next to the Send button. Clicking it opens a full-fidelity
preview of the email in a modal window, rendered exactly as it will
appear to the client — including the current update note, any manual
entries you have added, and all session update data. The preview
reflects the live state of the form, so if you add a note and click
Preview, the note appears in the preview immediately. From the preview
modal you can: click "Send Email" to send without closing the modal,
click "Go to Updates →" to return to the Updates page if something
needs to be retried, or click "Close & Edit" to return to the form
and make changes before sending.


= What happens when I retry an update that already succeeded? =
From v2.3, Greenskeeper checks whether the item already has a successful
update record in the current session before running the update again.
If it does, an amber informational notice appears explaining the item
is already up to date, with a Retry button still available if you want
to force a fresh check. The item is counted as successful so the batch
completion state is not affected.

= Why does the WordPress core update banner disappear after Greenskeeper updates core? =
Greenskeeper dismisses the WordPress "update available" admin banner
after a successful core update by clearing the update_core transient.
It then shows its own confirmation notice — "WordPress X.X updated
successfully" — which auto-dismisses after 4 seconds. This prevents
the WordPress banner from persisting and confusing the admin into
thinking the update needs to be retried.


= Does Greenskeeper conflict with WP Mail SMTP or other SMTP plugins? =
No — from v2.2.1 onward, Greenskeeper is always the sender of record
for its own emails by default. It applies its SMTP configuration only
to emails it initiates (maintenance reports, admin notifications, test
emails) and never interferes with WooCommerce, contact forms, password
resets, or any other plugin's mail. When Greenskeeper detects another
SMTP plugin on the site, it shows an informational notice on the SMTP
settings card naming the plugin and confirming Greenskeeper is operating
independently. If you prefer to hand delivery to the detected plugin,
a checkbox on the settings card lets you do that — with a clear warning
that a failure in that plugin may prevent Greenskeeper reports from
sending and will not appear in Greenskeeper's email log.

= Which SMTP plugins does Greenskeeper detect? =
Greenskeeper detects the following SMTP plugins: WP Mail SMTP,
FluentSMTP, Post SMTP, Postman SMTP, Easy WP SMTP, Brevo (Sendinblue),
Gravity SMTP, WP Offload SES, and Gmail SMTP. Detection covers both
site-activated and network-activated installations on multisite.


= Does Greenskeeper include a System Info report? =
Yes — from v2.1.11 onward, Greenskeeper includes a System Info page
(Greenskeeper → System Info in the WordPress admin sidebar). It displays
your full server environment (PHP version, extensions, server software),
WordPress environment (version, URLs, memory limit, debug mode, database),
active theme, and a complete list of active plugins with versions and authors.
A sticky copy-and-paste panel lets you copy the full report as plain text
to include in support tickets to plugin or theme developers.


= Does Greenskeeper send notifications to the administrator after updates? =
Yes — from v2.1.10 onward, Greenskeeper can send an internal notification
email to the performing administrator when a batch of updates completes.
Three notification types are available, each independently toggleable in
Greenskeeper → Settings → Email Notifications: (1) All updates succeeded
(off by default — routine clean batches don't need an email), (2) Some
updates failed (on by default — partial failures need attention), (3) All
updates failed (on by default — complete failures require immediate action).
These notifications go only to the administrator, not to the client.

= What happens when some updates fail and others succeed? =
The Updates page now shows one of three distinct states after a batch
completes: (A) All succeeded — green confirmation with a Send Report link;
(B) Partial success — amber warning showing how many succeeded and how many
failed, with options to retry the failed updates or send a report with only
the successful ones; (C) All failed — red warning with a Retry All option.
The Send Report link is never shown when all updates failed since there is
nothing to report.

= If I retry a failed update and it succeeds, does the failure still appear? =
No. If a plugin update fails and you retry it in the same session and the
retry succeeds, the failed row is suppressed from both the Update Log display
and the email report. Only the successful outcome is shown. The failed row
remains in the database for audit purposes but is hidden from the user-facing
views. This applies to both individual retries and batch retries.


= Does Greenskeeper log site activity and user logins? =
Yes — Greenskeeper includes a Site Activity Log that records user logins,
failed login attempts, plugin changes, theme switches, user account changes,
and WordPress core updates. The log is disabled by default and can be enabled
in Greenskeeper → Settings → Site Activity Log.

= Is the Site Activity Log GDPR compliant? =
Yes. The activity log is designed with GDPR data minimisation principles from
the ground up. IP addresses are anonymised by default — the last octet of IPv4
addresses and the last 80 bits of IPv6 addresses are zeroed before storage,
following the approach recommended by the European Data Protection Board. Log
entries are automatically purged after a configurable retention period (default
90 days). You can export all stored activity data as CSV to respond to Subject
Access Requests, and bulk-delete all entries at any time from the Site Activity
page. Full IP address storage is available as an explicit opt-in for sites with
a documented legitimate purpose under GDPR Article 6.

= What events does the Site Activity Log record? =
Authentication: user logins, failed login attempts, logouts, password reset
requests, password changes. User management: account creation and deletion,
role changes, administrator profile updates. Site changes: plugin activation,
deactivation and deletion, theme switches, WordPress core updates, and changes
to key WordPress options (site title, admin email, permalink structure, etc.).
Post and page editing activity is reserved for a future Pro version.

= How long does Greenskeeper keep activity log data? =
By default, log entries are automatically purged after 90 days via a daily
WordPress cron event. You can change the retention period in Greenskeeper →
Settings → Site Activity Log. Set the retention to 0 to keep entries
indefinitely (not recommended for GDPR compliance). Entries can also be
manually deleted individually or in bulk from the Site Activity page at
any time.

= Can I export the activity log for a GDPR Subject Access Request? =
Yes. The Site Activity page includes an Export CSV button that downloads all
stored activity log entries as a UTF-8 CSV file. You can also access the
export via Greenskeeper → Settings → Site Activity Log. The export includes
all logged fields: event type, category, summary, context, user ID, username,
display name, anonymised IP address, and timestamp.



= Does Greenskeeper report updates made outside the plugin? =

Yes, from version 1.9.1. Greenskeeper hooks into WordPress's
upgrader_process_complete action, which fires for any update that runs
through WordPress's standard Plugin_Upgrader or Theme_Upgrader — including
updates made from the WordPress Updates screen, the Avada plugins dashboard
(for Avada Core and Avada Builder), or any other standard WordPress update
mechanism.

These external updates are logged automatically with a session labelled
"External" in the Update Log, and are included as a separate "Updates Made
Outside Greenskeeper" section in the next maintenance report email.

= How does Greenskeeper handle Avada theme updates? =

Greenskeeper handles Avada-related updates in two ways depending on the
update type:

**Avada theme, Avada Core, and Avada Builder updates** — once your Avada
license is registered, these appear in the standard WordPress updates list
and can be updated from either the WordPress Updates screen or the Avada
plugins dashboard. Both routes fire WordPress's standard upgrade hooks.
Greenskeeper detects and logs these automatically and includes them in the
maintenance report email.

**Avada Patches** — patches applied through Avada's own Maintenance →
Plugins & Add-Ons dashboard use Avada's proprietary update mechanism and
do not fire WordPress's standard hooks. Greenskeeper cannot detect these
automatically. They should be documented manually using the Additional
Manual Updates field on the Email Reports page before sending the report.

The Updates page also shows a contextual notice when the Avada theme is
installed, explaining the required update order: Avada theme first, then
Avada Core, then Avada Builder.

= What is the difference between an external update and a manual update? =

An **external update** is one that Greenskeeper detected automatically
because it went through WordPress's standard update mechanism (Plugin_Upgrader
or Theme_Upgrader). These are logged and included in the email without
any action from you.

A **manual update** is one that Greenskeeper cannot detect — for example
an Avada Patch, a plugin updated through a vendor's own proprietary
dashboard, or an FTP file replacement. These must be documented using the
Additional Manual Updates field on the Email Reports page.

= Does the plugin support Avada theme updates? =

Yes, with important notes. Avada Core and Avada Builder appear in the standard
WordPress plugin update list once your Avada license is registered, and the plugin
can update them normally. The Updates page shows a contextual notice when Avada is
installed, explaining the required update order: Avada theme first, then Avada Core,
then Avada Builder. A confirmation prompt appears if you select the Avada theme for
update, reminding you to follow up with the companion plugins.

Avada Patches are managed separately through Avada's own dashboard (Avada →
Maintenance → Plugins & Add-Ons) and do not appear in the standard WordPress update
API, so they cannot be detected or applied from this plugin. The Updates page
includes a direct link to that dashboard so you can check after completing your
regular updates.


= Does this plugin support WordPress Multisite? =

Yes. It can be network-activated by a Super Admin to cover all sites simultaneously, or activated per-site by individual Administrators. Each site maintains its own isolated database tables, update log, and email log. The plugin handles cross-site AJAX correctly on Multisite so email sending always reads from the correct sub-site's log table.

= Why are my updates not showing in the Update Log? =

If you upgraded the plugin by uploading new files without deactivating first, the database schema may not have been upgraded. Open **Update Log**, expand the **Database Diagnostic** panel at the bottom, and click **Force DB Upgrade Now**. The panel shows both database tables with their column lists highlighted in green (present) or red (missing). After the upgrade click Refresh — all sessions should appear.

= Emails are not being delivered. What should I do? =

By default WordPress sends email via PHP's `mail()` function, which many hosting providers block or which major inboxes mark as spam. Go to **Settings → SMTP & Email Delivery** and configure a dedicated SMTP provider. Use **Send Test Email** to verify your connection before sending a real report. See the SMTP Setup Guides section below for step-by-step instructions for each supported provider.

= Why did a plugin or theme update fail? =

Premium and licensed plugins that require a valid license key for automatic updates will fail with a mapped error message. The Update Log and email reports both include a plain-English explanation and an action recommendation. These items must be updated manually through the vendor's dashboard or by providing a valid license key.

= Can I send the report email from a specific email address? =

Yes. Go to **Settings → SMTP & Email Delivery** and fill in the **From Name** and **From Email** fields. The From Email must be authorised to send from your SMTP provider or domain — using an unverified address is the most common cause of delivery failures.

= Can I update WordPress Core separately from plugins and themes? =

Yes. The Updates page has three separate sections — WordPress Core, Plugins, and Themes — each with its own Select All checkbox. You can update Core alone, plugins alone, themes alone, or any combination.

= Is my SMTP password stored securely? =

Yes. Passwords and API keys are encrypted with AES-256-CBC before being saved to the database. The encryption key is derived from your WordPress installation's AUTH_KEY and SECURE_AUTH_KEY constants, which are unique per site and defined in wp-config.php. The raw password is never output into the browser — only a masked placeholder is shown when a value is already saved.

= Where is the plugin data stored? =

Three custom database tables per site:
* `{prefix}_wpmm_update_log` — one row per update action (session_id, item_name, item_type, item_slug, old_version, new_version, status, error_code, message, updated_at)
* `{prefix}_wpmm_email_log` — one row per email send (session_id, to_email, subject, body, status, sent_at)
* `{prefix}_wpmm_spam_log` — one row per blocked comment attempt (rule, author_ip, author_name, author_email, author_url, comment_content, post_id, blocked_at)

Plugin settings (branding, SMTP, spam filter configuration, client email, default admin, API key) are stored in the `wpmm_settings` WordPress option.



= Can I review blocked spam comments? =

Yes. Go to **Site Maintenance → Spam Log**. Every comment attempt blocked by
any local filter rule (honeypot, time check, keyword, IP, link count, duplicate)
is logged there with the author's IP, name, email, and a content preview. Akismet-
blocked comments are logged here too and also appear in WordPress's native
Comments → Spam queue.

From the Spam Log you can: filter by rule or IP, add an IP to the blocklist
with one click, delete individual entries, or clear the entire log.



= Why were themes not showing in my email reports? =

This was a bug in versions prior to 1.9.1. Theme update log entries stored
with item_type as 'themes' (plural) were incorrectly bucketed into the
Plugins section. Version 1.9.1 normalises both spellings. No data was lost
— resending any previous email from the Sent Email History table will now
show themes in the correct Themes section.

= Does the email report include spam filter activity? =

Yes, from version 1.9.1. Every maintenance report email includes a Spam
Activity section listing comment attempts blocked since the last report was
sent. Each entry shows when it was blocked, which rule caught it, the
submitter's IP, and a content preview. If no spam was blocked since the
last report the section is omitted entirely.

= How does the administrator name appear in email reports? =

From version 1.9.1 the email uses the administrator's First Name and Last
Name from their WordPress user profile. Go to Users &rarr; Your Profile and
fill in the First Name and Last Name fields, then click Update Profile. If
no first or last name is saved, the Display Name is used as a fallback.

= Who can access Greenskeeper? =

By default, any WordPress Administrator can access the plugin. Once you save the
Manage Plugin Access settings (Settings → Manage Plugin Access), only the
administrators you have explicitly checked can see or use any part of the plugin.
Unchecked administrators see no menu item and cannot reach any plugin page.

Your own account is always locked in — you cannot accidentally remove your own
access from within the plugin.

= Can a client with Administrator access see the plugin? =

Not after you configure the Manage Plugin Access card. Go to
**Site Maintenance → Settings**, scroll to **Manage Plugin Access**, uncheck the
client's administrator account, and click **Save Access Settings**. That account
will no longer see the Site Maintenance menu or any plugin page.

= What if I get locked out of the plugin? =

Lockout cannot happen from within the plugin UI — your own account is always
kept in the access list automatically. If you are locked out through a direct
database change, connect to the database and either delete the `wpmm_settings`
option (which resets to the manage_options fallback) or add your user ID back
to the `access_user_ids` array in that option.

= Does the plugin support two-factor authentication? =

The plugin does not implement 2FA itself. Instead, it detects whether a 2FA plugin
is active and shows a notice on every plugin page if none is found, with direct
links to install WP 2FA or Two Factor. We recommend protecting the administrator
accounts that have wpmm_access with 2FA via one of these dedicated plugins:
WP 2FA (by Melapress), Two Factor (official WordPress.org plugin),
Wordfence Security, or iThemes Security Pro.


= How do spam filter settings work on a Multisite network? =

Each sub-site has its own independent spam filter settings stored in that
site's wpmm_settings option. From Network Admin, go to
Settings → Spam Filter & Comments. The All Sites view shows a summary table
of every site with its spam status, Akismet connection, and comments status.
Select a specific site from the Site Scope Bar to edit its settings. Changes
only affect that site and are saved immediately.

= Can I run updates for all sites at once, or only one site at a time? =

Both. In Network Admin, the Site Scope Bar on the Updates page defaults to
All Sites, which shows all available updates for all installed plugins and
themes. Selecting a specific site filters the list to only the plugins and
themes activated on that site, and runs updates in that site's context.

= Does the network email report cover all sites? =

Yes. When the Email Reports page is in All Sites scope (Network Admin,
no site selected), sending the report builds a consolidated email with a
section per site. Each section contains that site's own Core, Plugins, and
Themes update tables. When a single site is selected, the report covers
only that site in the standard single-site format.

= Does the spam filter work without an Akismet API key? =

Yes. The local filtering layer (honeypot field, submission time check, link count
limit, keyword blocklist, IP blocklist, and duplicate detection) runs entirely on
your server with no external API calls. Local filtering alone catches the majority
of automated bot spam. Adding an Akismet API key activates a second layer of
AI-powered cloud filtering for more comprehensive coverage.

= Do I need a paid Akismet account? =

Akismet's free plan is for personal, non-commercial sites only. Any commercial
website — including client sites managed by an agency — requires a paid Akismet
plan. Visit [akismet.com/plans](https://akismet.com/plans/) to choose the right
plan. Greenskeeper provides the Akismet integration; licensing is your
responsibility.

= Will the spam filter conflict with the standalone Akismet plugin? =

No. Greenskeeper detects when the standalone Akismet plugin is already
active and skips its own Akismet API call automatically. Only the local filtering
layer runs in that case, so you never get double-filtering. The Settings page shows
a notice when the standalone plugin is detected.

= What happens if Akismet is unreachable when a comment is submitted? =

The plugin fails open — the comment is allowed through rather than being blocked.
This prevents legitimate comments from being lost due to a temporary API outage or
network issue. Local filters still run normally regardless of Akismet availability.

= Can I disable comments completely across the entire site? =

Yes. The Disable Comments toggle in Settings → Spam Filter & Comments removes
comment support from every post type, closes all existing comments via WordPress
filter hooks, hides the Comments admin menu item, redirects direct access to the
comments admin page, and removes discussion meta boxes from the post and page
editors. This is a site-wide setting — it applies to all post types including
custom ones.

= How do I add an IP address to the blocklist after catching a spammer? =

Two ways to add an IP. From the **Spam Log** page, click the **Block IP** button on any row — the IP is added to the blocklist instantly without leaving the page. Alternatively go to **Settings → Spam Filter & Comments**, add the address to the Blocked IP Addresses textarea (one per line), and click **Save Spam Settings**.


= How does Greenskeeper handle Multisite networks? =

In Network Admin, a Site Scope Bar appears at the top of the Updates, Spam Log,
and Settings pages. You can select "All Sites" to operate across the entire
network, or choose a specific site to scope the view to that site only.

= What does "All Sites" mode do on the Updates page? =

In All Sites mode the Updates page shows every available update for every plugin
and theme installed on the network, regardless of which site has it activated.
Running updates applies them network-wide and logs results to the network admin
site's update log. The email report lists each site as a separate section with
its own Core, Plugins, and Themes tables.

= What does single-site scope do on the Updates page? =

When you select a specific site, the Updates page filters the plugin and theme
list to only show items activated on that site (including network-activated
plugins). Updates run in that site's context and log to that site's own
wpmm_update_log table. The email report uses the single-site format.

= Are spam filter settings shared across all sites in a network? =

No. Each site has its own independent spam filter settings. In Network Admin,
select a site from the scope bar on the Settings page to view and edit that
site's spam configuration. Selecting "All Sites" shows a summary table of all
sites with their spam filter status, Akismet connection status, and comments
toggle state.

= Can I use this plugin alongside WP Mail SMTP or other SMTP plugins? =

It is recommended to use either Greenskeeper's built-in SMTP configuration **or** a separate SMTP plugin — not both. Both plugins hook into `phpmailer_init` and will conflict. If you already have WP Mail SMTP, FluentSMTP, or Post SMTP installed and configured, leave Greenskeeper's SMTP setting on **WordPress Default** and let the other plugin handle delivery.

---

== SMTP Setup Guides ==

Greenskeeper includes a built-in SMTP configuration panel that reconfigures WordPress's email delivery without requiring a separate plugin. The following guides walk through setting up each supported provider.

Go to **Settings → SMTP & Email Delivery**, click your provider's tile, and enter the credentials described below.

---

= WordPress Default =

No configuration needed. WordPress sends email via PHP's built-in `mail()` function. This is unreliable on most shared hosting — emails are frequently blocked by spam filters or rejected by recipients' mail servers. Recommended only as a fallback.

---

= SMTP (Manual) =

Use this option with any SMTP server not listed as a named provider — for example your hosting provider's mail server or a self-hosted mail server.

**Fields:**
* **SMTP Host** — the address of your mail server (e.g. `mail.yourdomain.com`)
* **Port & Encryption** — port `587` with TLS is recommended for most servers; port `465` with SSL is also common; port `25` with no encryption should only be used on internal networks
* **Username** — your SMTP account login (usually your email address)
* **Password** — your SMTP account password
* **From Name** — the display name on outgoing emails
* **From Email** — must be authorised to send from your SMTP server

5. Set your verified sender address as the **From Email**.

**Server details (pre-configured):** `send.smtp.com` — port `587` — TLS

---

= Gmail / Google Workspace =

**Important:** Google disabled plain password (basic auth) for SMTP in May 2022. You must use an App Password. OAuth 2.0 is not supported by this plugin.

**Personal Gmail — setup steps:**
1. Sign in to your Google Account at [myaccount.google.com](https://myaccount.google.com).
2. Go to **Security** and confirm that **2-Step Verification** is turned on. (App Passwords are not available without it.)
3. In the Security search bar, search for **App Passwords**.
4. Click **Create**, choose **Other (custom name)**, and type `WordPress` or `Greenskeeper`.
5. Google displays a 16-character code. Copy it immediately — it will not be shown again.
6. In Greenskeeper Settings: select **Gmail / Google**, enter your full Gmail address (`you@gmail.com`) as the **Username**, and paste the 16-character App Password as the **Password**.
7. Set your Gmail address as the **From Email**.

**Google Workspace (paid) — setup steps:**
The App Password method above works identically for Workspace accounts. Alternatively, your Workspace admin can configure a **SMTP relay** in the Google Admin console (Apps → Google Workspace → Gmail → SMTP relay service), which allows sending from any user in your domain without per-account App Passwords and supports higher sending volumes.

**Server details (pre-configured):** `smtp.gmail.com` — port `587` — TLS/STARTTLS

*Gmail sending limits: personal accounts are limited to approximately 500 emails per day; Google Workspace accounts to 2,000 per day.*

---

= Microsoft / Outlook =

**Important:** Microsoft deprecated basic authentication for Exchange Online in October 2022 but preserved it specifically for SMTP AUTH submissions. App Passwords are required for personal accounts; organisation accounts need SMTP AUTH enabled by an admin.

**Personal Outlook.com accounts — setup steps:**
1. Go to [account.microsoft.com/security](https://account.microsoft.com/security).
2. Under **Advanced security options**, confirm **Two-step verification** is on.
3. Click **Create a new app password**.
4. Copy the generated password.
5. In Greenskeeper Settings: select **Microsoft / Outlook**, enter your full Outlook address (`you@outlook.com` or `you@hotmail.com`) as the **Username**, and the app password as the **Password**.

**Microsoft 365 / Office 365 organisations — setup steps:**
1. A Microsoft 365 admin must enable SMTP AUTH for the sending mailbox. In the **Microsoft 365 Admin Centre** go to: **Users → Active Users → select the user → Mail tab → Manage email apps → check Authenticated SMTP**.
2. Once enabled, use the regular Microsoft 365 email address and password as the Username and Password.
3. If your organisation enforces Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), generate an App Password from [mysignins.microsoft.com](https://mysignins.microsoft.com) → **Security info → Add method → App password**.

**Server details (pre-configured):** `smtp.office365.com` — port `587` — TLS/STARTTLS

*Note: For older personal Outlook.com accounts that do not connect on smtp.office365.com, try using the manual SMTP option with host `smtp-mail.outlook.com` on port `587`.*

== Changelog ==

= 2.4 =
* Feature: Disable All Auto-Updates. Amber warning banner on the
  Updates page shows how many plugins and themes have auto-updates
  enabled, with a one-click "Disable All Auto-Updates" button.
  Confirmation card appears on success with instructions for
  re-enabling individually and a link to the WordPress Plugins admin.
  Action logged to the Site Activity Log. Auto-Updates card on the
  Settings page shows current status and the same disable action.
* Feature: Automatic 502/503/504 backoff retry. When a plugin update
  returns a server error, Greenskeeper automatically waits and retries
  that specific item up to 2 additional times before marking it as
  failed — 5 seconds on the first retry, 10 seconds on the second.
  Item row shows "Server busy — retrying in X seconds..." and the
  progress bar label updates so the admin knows the batch has not
  frozen.
* Feature: Known heavy-hitter recovery pause. After updating
  resource-intensive plugins (AIOSEO, WooCommerce, Elementor, Gravity
  Forms, Wordfence, Yoast, Jetpack, RankMath, WPML, The Events
  Calendar, LearnDash, MemberPress), Greenskeeper inserts an 8-second
  recovery pause before starting the next update, with a progress
  label indicating the pause. All other updates retain the standard
  800ms inter-update delay.
* Fix: 502 error messages now distinguish between server-busy errors
  and genuine network failures, with specific guidance for each case.

= 2.3.10 =
* Feature: Automatic 502/503/504 backoff retry. When a plugin update
  returns a server error, Greenskeeper automatically waits and retries
  that specific item up to 2 additional times before marking it as
  failed — 5 seconds on the first retry, 10 seconds on the second.
  The item row shows "Server busy — retrying in 5 seconds..." and the
  progress bar label updates so the admin knows the batch hasn't frozen.
* Feature: Known heavy-hitter pause. After updating resource-intensive
  plugins (AIOSEO, WooCommerce, Elementor, Gravity Forms, Wordfence,
  Yoast, Jetpack, RankMath, WPML, The Events Calendar, LearnDash,
  MemberPress), Greenskeeper inserts an 8-second recovery pause before
  starting the next update, with a progress label indicating the pause.
  All other updates retain the standard 800ms inter-update delay.
* Fix: 502 error messages now distinguish between server-busy errors
  and genuine network failures, with appropriate guidance for each.

= 2.3.9 =
* Feature: Disable All Auto-Updates — amber warning banner on the
  Updates page shows how many plugins and themes have auto-updates
  enabled, with a "Disable All Auto-Updates" button that disables
  them in one click. On success shows a green confirmation card with
  instructions on re-enabling individually and a link to the
  WordPress Plugins admin. Logged to the Site Activity Log.
* Feature: Auto-Updates settings card on the Settings page shows
  current auto-update status (green if all disabled, amber if any
  enabled), a Disable All button when needed, and persistent
  instructions for re-enabling via the WordPress Plugins screen.
* Feature: Per-item Retry button on Updates page now correctly
  passes is_retry flag through runUpdatesSequential so the
  already_succeeded server-side guard is bypassed on explicit
  retries.

= 2.3.8 =
* Feature: Universal external update detection. Greenskeeper now
  detects plugin and theme version changes made by any external tool
  — Avada's dashboard, Divi's updater, WP Rocket, ACF Pro, Gravity
  Forms, Elementor Pro, and 40+ other known plugin families — by
  comparing a stored version snapshot against currently installed
  versions on every admin page load. Detected changes are logged to
  the Update Log and included in the next email report under "Updates
  Outside Greenskeeper." Already-logged Greenskeeper updates are
  filtered out to prevent duplication.
* Feature: Grouped email section for external updates. The "Updates
  Outside Greenskeeper" email section now groups updates by product
  family with a sub-heading for each (e.g. Avada Theme Suite, Gravity
  Forms, Elementor, WP Rocket). Each family shows a table with plugin
  name, old → new version, and status. Updates not matching a known
  family appear under "Other External Updates."
* Feature: Product family map covering 40+ known plugin and theme
  families using pattern-based slug matching. New plugins in a known
  family are detected automatically without any code changes.
* Fix: Per-item Retry button now passes is_retry=true to the server
  so the already_succeeded guard is bypassed on explicit retries.
* Fix: Amber notices and Retry buttons now cleared on all-success
  completion from both initial batch and retry passes.

= 2.3.7 =
* Fix: Subsequent plugin updates failing after one failure. The
  already_succeeded check was firing for ALL update attempts including
  retries, causing cascading false positives. The check now only runs
  on initial batch updates, never on explicit retries.
* Fix: Retry button showing "already succeeded" instead of running the
  update. Added is_retry flag passed from JS to AJAX handler. When
  is_retry=1 the already_succeeded guard is bypassed entirely and the
  update runs unconditionally.
* Fix: Amber "already succeeded" notices and Retry buttons persisting
  after all updates complete successfully. Notices are now cleared and
  Retry buttons disabled when the green success banner appears, on both
  the initial pass and after a successful retry pass.

= 2.3.6 =
* Fix: Retry success banner not updating when a previously failed
  update returned "already succeeded" on retry. The progress bar
  was not being shown during the retry pass, which prevented the
  sequential runner's done callback from completing correctly.
  Progress bar now shows during retry with "Retrying N updates..."
  label. Added guard to prevent retry running with empty items list.

= 2.3.5 =
* Fix: Retry success banner not updating after a failed update was
  retried and succeeded. The amber "13 of 14 updates completed" banner
  was not changing to the green success banner because of a duplicate
  var totalItems declaration that caused a scoping conflict. Removed
  the duplicate, unified totalItems as a single declaration that
  persists across all retry passes. First-pass partial banner now also
  uses totalItems as the denominator for consistency.

= 2.3.4 =
* Fix: Plugin names displayed as raw file paths (e.g.
  perfmatters/perfmatters.php) in email report "Needs Attention"
  section. When item_name contains a file path, the name is now
  extracted and title-cased for client-friendly display.
* Fix: Missing reason text in "Needs Attention" email rows. When
  no specific error code or message was available, the warning icon
  appeared with no explanation. A fallback reason is now always
  shown so the client always knows what action to take.
* Fix applied to both the client-facing email report and the
  internal admin notification email.
* FAQ: Added entry explaining how WordPress.org's "Protect The
  Shire" 24-hour update hold policy affects Greenskeeper users.

= 2.3.3 =
* Fix: Malformed FAQ heading for the core update banner question — the
  heading spanned two lines in readme.txt causing a rendering artifact
  on the WordPress.org plugin page.
* Fix: Freemius Upgrade link hidden until Pro plans are fully configured
  and ready to launch. has_paid_plans set to false temporarily — will
  be restored to true when the Pro tier goes live.
* Copy: SMTP & Email Delivery settings card description updated to
  reflect Greenskeeper's role as sender of record for its own emails.

= 2.3.2 =
* Fix: Freemius opt-in "Allow and Continue" button was redirecting to
  the site home URL instead of the Greenskeeper dashboard. Fixed by
  adding after_activation_url to fs_dynamic_init pointing to the
  Greenskeeper dashboard page.

= 2.3.1 =
* Feature: Pre-send email preview on the Email Reports page. A "Preview
  Email" button appears next to the Send button whenever there are
  pending sessions to send. Clicking it opens the existing email modal
  in pre-send mode, rendering a full-fidelity preview of exactly what
  will be sent to the client — including the current update note, manual
  entries, and all session update data. The preview reflects the live
  state of the form at the moment Preview is clicked. The modal footer
  offers three actions: "Send Email" (sends directly from the modal
  without closing it), "Go to Updates →" (navigates to the Updates page
  if something needs to be retried or corrected), and "Close & Edit"
  (returns to the form to make changes before sending). The preview uses
  a new wpmm_preview_email AJAX handler that builds the full email body
  using the same wpmm_build_email_body() function as the send handler
  but saves nothing — no log entry, no pending session changes.

= 2.3 =
* Feature: About the Developer card shown below the donation card on
  every page. Includes Tony Zeoli's Gravatar (pulled live), two
  paragraphs of background on Greenskeeper's origin and Tony's
  WordPress contributions, and links to tonyzeoli.com,
  digitalstrategyworks.com, and radiostation.pro.
* Feature: Retry banner now turns green when all retries succeed.
  Tracks cumulative success/fail counts across all retry passes using
  totalItems so the denominator is always the full original batch count.
  The green banner shows "All 12 of 12 updates completed successfully"
  and fires the admin notification email on retry success.
* Feature: WordPress core update confirmation notice. After a successful
  core update, Greenskeeper dismisses the WordPress "update available"
  banner (deletes the update_core transient) and injects a green
  confirmation notice above the shell: "WordPress X.X updated
  successfully." Auto-dismisses with a fade after 4 seconds.
* Feature: Already-succeeded retry warning. Before running any update,
  Greenskeeper checks whether that item already has a success row in the
  current session's update log. If so, shows an amber informational
  notice explaining the item is already up to date, with the Retry
  button still available for a force retry. Item counted as successful
  so batch completion state is not affected.
* Feature: No-pending-update error now shown as amber informational
  message rather than red failure. Updated copy explains the item may
  have already been updated and directs the admin to the Update Log.
* Feature: Persistent session queue for Email Reports (wpmm_queued_session
  option). Update Log "Send to Email Reports" button queues the session
  via AJAX and navigates cleanly to Email Reports where a blue
  confirmation panel shows the session date and exact update counts.
  Panel persists until email is sent or admin clears it. Clear Session
  button with confirmation warning dialog.
* Fix: Email log not updating after send. Session ID now passed directly
  from the AJAX handler to wpmm_send_email() — no longer read from
  wpmm_last_session which could be stale. Note column handled gracefully
  for pre-v2.1.6 installs.
* Fix: Email history row not appearing after send. JS row ID sanitised
  to safe DOM selector string with Date.now() fallback.
* Fix: Email report could miss entries when retry interrupted session
  aggregation. AJAX send handler now reads all update_log rows for the
  session directly from the database.

= 2.2.4 =
* Fix: Email log not updating after send. The wpmm_send_email() function
  was reading session_id from wpmm_last_session which could be stale or
  mismatched. Now accepts session_id as a parameter passed directly from
  the AJAX handler — the correct session is always logged. Also added
  graceful handling for sites where the note column does not yet exist
  in wpmm_email_log (pre-v2.1.6 installs).
* Fix: JS email history row prepend failed silently when email_id was 0.
  Row ID is now sanitised to a safe DOM selector string before use, with
  a timestamp fallback ensuring the row always lands and flashes green.

= 2.2.3 =
* Feature: Persistent session queue for Email Reports. When the admin
  clicks "Send to Email Reports" on any Update Log session, the session
  is stored in a WordPress option (wpmm_queued_session) via AJAX and
  the admin is navigated to Email Reports. The queued session panel
  appears automatically regardless of how the admin arrives at the
  screen — it persists across page loads and navigation until the
  email is sent or the admin explicitly clears it.
* Feature: Clear session button on the queued session panel. A "Clear
  Session" button appears on the panel with a confirmation dialog
  warning the admin that clearing removes the queue pointer (not the
  underlying update records, which remain in the Update Log). On
  confirmation the panel fades out and the queue is cleared.
* Feature: Update Log "Send to Email Reports" button on every non-legacy
  session. Clicking queues that session persistently via AJAX (no URL
  parameters) then navigates to Email Reports where the confirmation
  panel immediately shows the session date, counts of plugins/themes/
  core updates, and failed items excluded.
* Fix: Session queue clears automatically on successful email send so
  the next batch starts fresh.

= 2.2.2 =
* Fix: Email report sent from Updates page or Update Log "Send Report"
  button could miss entries when a retry interrupted session aggregation.
  The AJAX send handler now reads ALL update_log rows for the session
  directly from the database — the same query the Update Log page uses —
  rather than relying on pending_sessions state which can be incomplete
  after retries or page navigation.
* Feature: Session confirmation panel on Email Reports page when arriving
  from the Update Log "Send Report" button. Shows the session date, count
  of plugins/themes/core updates loaded, and count of failed items excluded.
  Confirms exactly what data will be included in the email before the admin
  sends it, eliminating ambiguity about completeness.
* Fix: Admin notices from Greenskeeper and other plugins now render above
  the Greenskeeper shell rather than inside the content area. The .wpmm-wrap
  div is now closed inside wpmm_page_header() before the shell opens, so
  WordPress injects notices into the wrap (above the shell) as expected.

= 2.2.1 =
* Fix: WordPress admin notices from Greenskeeper and other plugins now
  render above the Greenskeeper UI shell rather than being injected into
  the content area. The new v2.2 shell layout caused notices to appear
  mid-page. Fixed by firing admin_notices and all_admin_notices manually
  before the shell opens, then removing the hooks to prevent duplication.
* Feature: Greenskeeper SMTP conflict resolution. Greenskeeper is now
  always the sender of record for its own emails by default. A new
  wpmm_wp_mail() wrapper function sets $GLOBALS['wpmm_sending'] = true
  around every Greenskeeper wp_mail() call so the phpmailer_init hook
  applies Greenskeeper's SMTP settings only to Greenskeeper's own email
  — never to WooCommerce orders, contact forms, or any other plugin's
  mail. When another SMTP plugin is detected (WP Mail SMTP, FluentSMTP,
  Post SMTP, Easy WP SMTP, Brevo, Gravity SMTP, WP Offload SES, Gmail
  SMTP, Postman SMTP), an informational notice appears on the SMTP
  settings card naming the detected plugin and confirming Greenskeeper
  is operating independently. A checkbox lets the admin explicitly defer
  to the detected plugin instead, with a clear warning that doing so may
  impact email log integrity if that plugin fails. The SMTP card remains
  fully visible and editable in both states.

= 2.2 =
* Feature: Vertical sidebar navigation — replaced the horizontal tab
  bar with a vertical left-sidebar navigation panel. The sidebar is
  dark navy matching the header, uses icon + label links with a blue
  left-border active indicator, and has no width constraint — all 8
  navigation items display on single lines with no wrapping. The main
  content area is now full-width with no max-width cap, giving all
  pages significantly more horizontal real estate. A new wpmm-shell /
  wpmm-body / wpmm-sidebar / wpmm-content-area CSS layout replaces the
  old wpmm-tabs horizontal nav. wpmm_page_footer() added to close the
  shell structure at the end of each page renderer.

= 2.1.11 =
* Feature: System Info page — a new dedicated admin page (Greenskeeper →
  System Info) that displays a full report of the server and WordPress
  environment for use when submitting support tickets. Includes:
  Server Environment (OS, software, PHP version with compatibility
  indicators, PHP max input vars, PHP max post size, GD/Zip/cURL/mbstring
  extension status); WordPress Environment (version, site/home URLs,
  multisite, max upload size, memory limit, permalink structure, language,
  timezone, admin email, debug mode, database version, table prefix);
  Active Theme (name, version, author, URI, child theme indicator);
  Active Plugins (name, version, author — all active plugins including
  network-activated on multisite, sorted alphabetically). A sticky
  copy-and-paste sidebar lets you copy the full system report as plain
  text to include in support tickets to plugin developers.
* Compatibility: Tested and confirmed compatible with WordPress 7.0.
  Tested up to value updated to 7.0. Requires at least and Requires PHP
  added to the plugin file header (previously only in readme.txt).

= 2.1.10.3 =
* Fix: Plugin/theme names were blank in the admin notification email.
  Batch results are now collected directly from AJAX responses as each
  update completes, not from DOM scraping after the fact.
* Compatibility: Tested and confirmed compatible with WordPress 7.0.
  Tested up to value updated. Requires at least PHP 8.0 (above the new
  WordPress 7.0 minimum of PHP 7.4). No code changes required for the
  iframed editor (Greenskeeper has no block editor integration), the
  AI Client API, Connections API, or Abilities API.

= 2.1.10.2 =
* Fix: All three batch completion banners (green/amber/red) were visible
  simultaneously on the Updates page after a batch completed. The CSS
  display:flex rule on .wpmm-notice was overriding the HTML hidden
  attribute, causing all three banners to render visible regardless of
  the batch outcome. Fixed by adding .wpmm-notice[hidden] { display:
  none !important } to admin.css so the hidden attribute always wins.

= 2.1.10.1 =
* Fix: WordPress core updates run through Greenskeeper were not appearing
  in the email report. Root cause: after a successful core update WordPress
  forces a page reload which resets the JS sessionId variable. The Email
  Reports page hidden session field was populated from wpmm_last_session
  at PHP render time, but since the page was not reloaded after the core
  update the field still referenced the previous session. Fixed by
  populating the hidden field from the most recent wpmm_pending_sessions
  entry instead of wpmm_last_session — pending sessions is updated
  server-side and survives the page reload correctly.
* Fix: WordPress core updates made outside Greenskeeper (via the standard
  WordPress Updates screen) are now captured in the Update Log. The
  external update catcher previously excluded core updates explicitly.

= 2.1.10 =
* Fix: Update Log now suppresses failed rows when a retry in the same
  session succeeded. The failed row remains in the database for audit
  purposes but is hidden from the Update Log display and excluded from
  email reports. Rule: most recent row per plugin slug wins within a
  session. Applied to both the Update Log page renderer and the email
  body builder.
* Feature: Three batch completion states on the Updates page. Previously
  a single green banner appeared after every batch regardless of outcome.
  Now: (A) all succeeded — green banner with Send Report link; (B) partial
  success — amber warning with Retry Failed and Send Partial Report options;
  (C) all failed — red warning with Retry All option. Send Report is never
  shown when all updates failed.
* Feature: Admin notification emails — Greenskeeper can now send an
  internal notification email to the performing administrator when a batch
  completes. Three notification types, each independently toggleable in
  Settings: all updates succeeded (off by default), some updates failed
  (on by default), all updates failed (on by default). The notification
  email is separate from the client-facing report and includes a summary
  of successes and failures with links to the Update Log and Email Reports.
* Feature: Email Notifications settings card in Settings — toggle each
  admin notification type on or off independently.
* Fix: WordPress core updates made outside Greenskeeper (via the standard
  WordPress Updates screen) are now captured in the Update Log and included
  in the next email report. Previously the external update catcher
  explicitly excluded core updates. The new version is read from the global
  $wp_version (already updated at hook time); the old version from the
  update_core transient's version_checked property.

= 2.1.9 =
* Feature: Resend from Update Log — each session in the Update Log now
  has a "Send Report →" button that navigates to the Email Reports page
  with that session pre-loaded. If the session was previously emailed,
  an amber notice shows when it was sent and to whom. The subject line
  is automatically prefixed with [Updated Report] and the email body
  includes a blue banner informing the recipient this is an update to
  a previously sent report, with the original send date and time.
* Fix: Manual updates on the Email Reports page are now always included
  alongside the automated session log entries when sending — previously
  adding manual entries caused only the manual entries to appear in the
  email, dropping the full automated update list.

= 2.1.8 =
* Fix: Email Reports scope selector now honored on multisite (Codex
  audit issue #3). When a specific site is selected in Network Admin,
  the Email Reports page now switches to that site's context before
  reading the recipient email, site name, site URL (for the subject
  line), pending sessions, last session, default administrator, and
  email log history.
* Fix: Scoped update filtering no longer applied in wrong blog context
  (Codex audit issue #4). A redundant second filtering pass read
  active_plugins and active theme AFTER restore_current_blog() was
  called, filtering against the main site instead of the selected site.
  Removed — the first pass already filters correctly using values
  captured while switch_to_blog() was active.
* Fix: Removed blocking wp_update_plugins() and wp_update_themes()
  calls from wpmm_get_available_updates() which is called from AJAX.
  These caused HTTP 500 on managed hosting (Kinsta, WP Engine).
* Fix: Performing administrator no longer lost on page navigation
  (Codex audit issue #5). The admin_id selected on the Updates page
  is now stored in wpmm_pending_sessions alongside the session_id.
  When the email is sent from the Email Reports page (cross-page flow),
  the stored admin_id is read from the most recent pending session
  rather than defaulting to 0. Falls back to the site default admin
  if no session admin_id is available. Previously all of these were read from the main
  site regardless of which site was selected in the scope bar.

= 2.1.7 =
* Feature: Site Activity Log — a new dedicated admin page that tracks and
  logs key site events including user logins, failed login attempts,
  logouts, password resets, user account creation and deletion, role
  changes, plugin activation/deactivation/deletion, theme switches,
  WordPress core updates, and key settings changes. Built with GDPR
  compliance as a first principle: IP addresses are anonymised by default
  (last octet of IPv4 / last 80 bits of IPv6 zeroed), a configurable
  retention period (default 90 days) auto-purges old entries via daily
  wp-cron, a full CSV data export tool supports Subject Access Requests,
  and all entries can be bulk-deleted at any time. Full IP storage is
  available as an explicit opt-in for sites with a documented legitimate
  purpose. The activity log can be enabled or disabled independently from
  a new section in Greenskeeper Settings.

= 2.1.6 =
* Feature: Administrator notes are now stored permanently with each sent
  email. Previously the note was only included in the rendered email body
  at send time — if the template changed, historical previews lost the
  note. A new 'note' column is added to wpmm_email_log (existing installs
  are upgraded automatically on first load). The raw note text is stored
  separately from the HTML body so previews always show the exact note the
  administrator typed, regardless of how the email template has evolved.
  The preview modal displays the note in a prominently styled amber block
  above the email iframe. Emails sent before v2.1.6 show no note block
  (null note value) — only emails sent from this version onward will have
  the note stored.

= 2.1.5 =
* Fix: Update Notes field content was being added below the spam section
  where it was easy to miss. Note now appears prominently at the top of the
  email body immediately below the report heading, ensuring clients always
  see administrator notes before the update tables.
* Fix: Failed update rows in the email template now use amber styling
  ("Needs Attention" with amber background) instead of large red text
  ("Update Failed" in red). License-gated plugins show a friendly
  client-facing message instead of a technical error code. DEBUG diagnostic
  strings are stripped from messages before they reach the client email.
* Fix: iThemes Security Pro, Google Site Kit, and ShortPixel Image
  Optimizer were being deactivated after updates and not restored.
  These plugins intentionally self-deactivate during their update
  process via their own upgrader_process_complete hooks, then expect
  the updater to re-activate them afterward. The previous snapshot/
  restore approach ran before these self-deactivation hooks fired and
  therefore could not catch them.
  Added a new wpmm_post_update_reactivate() hook on
  upgrader_process_complete at priority 99 — deliberately very late
  so it runs after all plugin-specific hooks. It has two jobs:
  (1) Re-activate the plugin that Greenskeeper just updated if it
  ended up inactive after its own hooks ran; (2) Restore any other
  plugin that was active before the update but is now inactive as
  collateral damage. Uses is_plugin_active_for_network() on multisite
  to correctly handle network-activated vs site-activated plugins,
  and activate_plugin($slug, '', $is_network) accordingly.

= 2.1.4 =
* Fix: PHP Warning "Undefined variable $api_key" on the Settings page.
  The variable was renamed to $api_key_set in v2.0.5 but one reference
  in the REST API endpoints section was not updated.
* Fix: Email reports only showing the most recent session when multiple
  unsent sessions exist. The pending sessions list is now always cleared
  after any successful send, regardless of whether it was triggered from
  the Updates page or the Email Reports page.
* Fix: WooCommerce and other hook-sensitive plugins (WP Rocket, Wordfence,
  Really Simple SSL) not fully restored after collateral deactivation.
  These plugins register activation hooks that are bypassed by direct
  option writes. After the option write, activate_plugin() is now called
  for any hook-sensitive plugin in the restore list to ensure their
  activation hooks fire and they are fully re-initialized.
* Fix: Sent Email History row not appearing after send when the email
  log database insert returns ID 0 (can occur on multisite when the
  email_log table is in a different blog context). A timestamp-based
  fallback row ID is now used when email_id is 0, ensuring the row
  always appears immediately in the history table.

= 2.1.3 =
* Fix: HTTP 500 errors on some multisite networks caused by the per-site
  snapshot loop introduced in v2.1.1. Both the snapshot and restore loops
  are now wrapped in try/catch blocks for graceful fallback.
* Fix: HTTP 500 caused by premium plugins with custom updater libraries
  (e.g. WP Offload Media Pro / Delicious Brains updater) throwing ValueError
  or other exceptions during Plugin_Upgrader::upgrade(). All four upgrader
  calls (plugin normal path, plugin injected-entry path, theme normal path,
  theme injected-entry path) are now wrapped in try/catch Throwable blocks.
  When a plugin's own updater throws an exception, Greenskeeper catches it
  and returns a descriptive error message rather than an HTTP 500, directing
  the user to update via Dashboard → Updates as a fallback.

= 2.1.1 =
* Fix: Plugins activated only on a specific sub-site (not network-activated)
  could still be deactivated by collateral damage during updates. Previous
  versions only snapshotted the primary site's active_plugins and the network
  active_sitewide_plugins — missing plugins like Custom Post Type UI that are
  activated per-site on individual sub-sites. The snapshot now reads
  active_plugins from every site in the network. The restore checks each
  sub-site's current active_plugins against its snapshot and re-activates
  any plugin that was deactivated as collateral damage. The updated snapshot
  is persisted back to the network transient so retries also have access to
  the corrected per-site state.

= 2.1.0 =
* Critical fix: network-activated plugins (AIOSEO, Co-Authors Plus,
  Gravity Forms, Sucuri) were still being deactivated on subdirectory
  multisite networks despite the v2.0.8 fix. Three root causes identified
  and resolved: (1) the snapshot was being taken AFTER switch_to_blog(),
  meaning it captured the sub-site plugin list rather than the main site
  network state; (2) per-blog transients (get_transient/set_transient)
  were used for the snapshot, which are stored in the current blog's
  options table and lost when blog context switches mid-request — replaced
  with network-level site transients (get_site_transient/set_site_transient);
  (3) restore_current_blog() was called after reading the post-update plugin
  state, meaning the comparison was in the wrong blog context — blog context
  is now restored before reading post-update state so both snapshot and
  post-update reads happen in the same (main site) context.

= 2.0.9 =
* Critical fix: HTTP 500 errors on managed hosting (Kinsta, WP Engine)
  during plugin and theme updates. Root cause: wp_update_plugins() and
  wp_update_themes() make loopback HTTP requests back to the WordPress.org
  API. When called from within an AJAX request, these loopback requests
  are blocked or time out on managed hosting, causing the outer AJAX
  request to return HTTP 500. All blocking wp_update_plugins/themes()
  calls during AJAX update requests have been replaced with a non-blocking
  wp-cron background event (wpmm_refresh_update_transient) that fires
  after the request completes. The upgrader proceeds with the existing
  transient URL and the next retry benefits from the refreshed URL.

= 2.0.8 =
Critical fix: network-activated plugins (Site Kit, Sucuri, Clarity) restored after collateral deactivation.
Email: multiple sessions grouped by date with clear headers.
